# Create ACF Block JSON

> Quickly create a new [WordPress](https://wordpress.org) Block that uses [Advanced Custom Fields](https://www.advancedcustomfields.com) (ACF) and utilises block.json and block-specific CSS and PHP files.

If you use ACF and make Gutenberg blocks, this simple utility should save you time scaffolding custom blocks.

Minimum supported WordPress version: 6.5

## Quick Start

Install globally via npm:

```sh
npm install --global create-acf-block-json
```

then navigate to where you want your block to be (i.e. /theme/blocks/), and run:

```
$ create-acf-block-json
```

## What does Create ACF Block JSON do

Create ACF Block JSON is an npm package command line program that will create a new folder in your current directory containing scaffolding for a new WordPress block using Advanced Custom Fields.

It will generate:

- Folder - containing folder for your block.
- block.json - prefilled with common block information and default values.
- PHP file - setup with basic information, classes and innerblocks.
- SCSS files - for the frontend and editor. SCSS is useful if you use a compiler to output CSS files.
- CSS file - for the frontend and editor. To write straight CSS or be overwritten by your processed SCSS.

The script handles generating a unique class (.wp-block-namespace-name) for your block which is then referenced in each file.

This script doesn't handle registration of the block - we recommend directory scanning methods to auto load blocks without registering each one. This method is outlined by [Bill Erickson](https://www.billerickson.net/building-acf-blocks-with-block-json/#advanced-usage), but there are [other examples](https://github.com/cncf/cncf.io/blob/0233ccfa1fb24d46ce119049b010a18a0e3d91d3/web/wp-content/themes/cncf-twenty-two/includes/acf.php#L19) online. This blog post by ACF also talks about how to register an ACF block, [follow this guide](https://www.advancedcustomfields.com/resources/how-to-upgrade-a-legacy-block-to-block-json-with-acf-6/). FYI, many guides are out of date, make sure you use guides released after 28th September 2022 (when ACF 6.0 was released) which will properly use block.json. If you want a very quick bit of PHP to register your new block, you can use this:

```
/**
 * Load My Create ACF Block JSON Blocks
 */
function thetwopct_load_acf_blocks() {
        register_block_type( get_template_directory() . '/blocks/my-acf-block/block.json' );
      // register_block_type( get_template_directory() . '/blocks/another-block/block.json' );
}
add_action( 'init', 'thetwopct_load_acf_blocks' );
````

## Customisation Options

When you run `create-acf-block-json` you are asked a few questions before your block is created:

- Namespace: Specify a namespace for the block (defaults to `acf`)
- Name: Give your block a name, i.e. "My Cool Block" (required)
- Description: Describe the functionality of your block so editors and users can find it easily (optional)
- Icon: The icon for your block - use any [Dashicons](https://developer.wordpress.org/resource/dashicons/) name (defaults to icon `star-filled`). Note, when copying the name of the Dashicon you must remove the prefix `dashicons-`, for example: `dashicons-smiley` should be written as `smiley`.

The script will then generate all required files. From there, you can edit, delete, remove the files as you wish.

## Customising your block options via block.json

The package creates a block.json for you to customise your block. We declare all features with their defaults ready for you to set the block up as you need. Consult the [Block Supports API](https://developer.wordpress.org/block-editor/reference-guides/block-api/block-supports/) for more information on each setting.

## How to access the Block Supports setting and include them?

We include some examples in the main PHP file in the block. You can access other settings by accessing the setting on the $block array. Be aware that some settings need additional claseses to properly work (see background). For example:

```php
$font_size = ( empty( $block['fontSize'] ) ) ? '' : 'has-' . $block['fontSize'] . '-font-size';
$align_text = ( empty( $block['align_text'] ) ) ? '' : 'has-text-align-' . $block['align_text'];
$background = ( empty( $block['backgroundColor'] ) ) ? '' : 'has-' . $block['backgroundColor'] . '-background-color';
$has_background = $background ? 'has-background' : null;
```

## Install Create ACF Block

1. Using terminal or another CLI, download from npm and install as a global package - `npm install -g create-acf-block-json`
2. Using terminal or another CLI, navigate to your WordPress theme folder where you want all of your blocks (we use /wp-content/themes/my-theme/blocks/)
3. Run `create-acf-block-json` and follow prompts.

## Update Create ACF Block

To update to the latest version you can just run the install command again - `npm install -g create-acf-block-json`
